# star-crossed-dating-app

## Description

Our motivation for creating this project was to create a fun dating app that allows users to create profiles for various space objects. We also wanted to practice creating an app from front to back, utilzing MVC file structure & handlebars. This is a fun application that allows users to be creative and view potential matches. During this project we learned a lot about MVC file structure, how to use handlebars to change views and dynamically pull data from our database.

## Usage

To use our app, you can click the sign up button, and fill out form. Once you submit that, your information will be added to the database, and you will be routed to the profile carousel. You can scroll through profiles, like or dislkike them, and there's also an interactive map which can be viewed by clicking the map link.

## Future Development

We will continue to add new features and make the app more dynamic. We'd like to create one profile view and use handlebars variables to dynamically swap the informaiton from our database so users can view all the available profiles in the database.
